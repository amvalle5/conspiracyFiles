            <h2>Was the Moon Landing a Hoax?</h2>
            <div class="moonLandContent">
                <img src="Images/moonlanding.jpg" alt="Moon Landing">
                <p>On July 20, 1969, over 600 million people watched as Neil Armstrong took "one small step for man" and walked on the surface of the moon. But not everyone is convinced it actually happened.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 id="claims">Common Claims:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Waving Flag: In the moon footage, the American flag appears to ripple—even though there's no atmosphere on the moon.</li>
                <li>No Stars in Photos: Critics ask why stars aren't visible in any of the pictures taken on the moon's surface.</li>
                <li>Odd Shadows: Shadows in the images seem to fall in strange directions, suggesting artificial lighting.</li>
                <li>Perfectly Framed Shots: How did they get such well-composed photographs if no one was behind the camera?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>NASA's Response:</h3>
            <p>NASA and scientists have debunked these claims many times. The flag's movement is explained by momentum from being planted, stars are too faint to appear in the camera's exposure settings, and shadow angles can be explained by the lunar terrain. The cameras were also mounted on the astronauts' suits.</p>
            <h3>So... Was It Real?</h3>
            <p>Millions believe the moon landing was one of humanity's greatest achievements. Others still aren't buying it. We'll leave the decision up to you.</p>
